# Abstract {-}

Beer yeast has undergone extensive domestication throughout history reinforcing desirable traits such as malt sugar utilization, and a lack of off-flavor production within these strains. In particular the advent of refrigeration, and single strain isolation in the late nineteenth century, while leading to an increase in product quality and reliability, also led to an overall loss in beer strain diversity (Gallone Nature E&E 2019). Recent demand for increased diversity ??? flavor, styles, but also efficiency & technological improvements. Traditionally fermentation sources offer additional diversity ??? in particular farmhouse ales have undergone some level of phenotypic selection ??? lack of phenolic off flavors and sugar utilization ??? but show increased diversity of additional traits including temperature tolerance and fermentation speed. We isolated >1200 single colonies from 28 farmhouse ale cultures to investigate population diversity. From these we selected ~180 diverse strains for phenotypic screening for stress resistance, fermentation performance and flavor production. From these a further 20 were selected for whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Further, a small selection of strains were chosen for their potential in more efficient high-temperature pseudo-lager beer production and taken to pilot scale fermentation and sensorially assessed by a tasting panel.
