<p>To detect Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and major aneuploidies, we use the CNVnator pipeline. We use the bam files containing informations on aligned reads to the reference S288C genome, and we call CNVs based on changes of depth of mapped reads. The protocol we follow is:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each sample, run CNVnator for 500 bp and 1,000 bp bins;</li>
<li>Retain only CNVs that are concordant for both bins;</li>
<li>Identify common CNVs pattern;</li>
<li>Identify genes affected by CNVs;</li>
<li>GO, KEGG and Reactome pathways enrichment</li>
</ul>
<div id="call-cnvs" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Call CNVs<a href="copy-number-variants.html#call-cnvs" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>First, we call CNVs with CNVnator, using 500 bp and 1,000 bp bins. Then, for each samples, we retain only CNVs that have been called with both bins, and that had a p-value &lt; 0.05.</p>

To facilitate the visualization, duplications have been amplified up to 10X, while deletion have been reduced to 1X. Farmhouse yeasts have been clustered based on their geographical origin, in order from the top to the bottom:</p>

Figure 2.2: Copy Number Variants in farmhouse yeasts VS industrial strains
</p>
</div>
<p>While there is no clear signature associated with kveiks geographic origin, it looks like there are common CNVs shared between farmhouse yeasts that are instead absent in industrial yeasts. Let’s clearly identify them.</p>
<p>There are the apparent trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 out of 69 CNVs are shared among all Kveiks</li>
<li>Granvin1, Hornindal1, Hornindal2, Voss1 have similar CNV fingerprint</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a bunch of CNVs called on 44 different kveiks Some CNVs that are called on the same position on multiple samples, maybe differs for few hundred base pairs. To identify the “average” conserved CNV, we use a custom python script that collapse this windows, a sort of <em>ad hoc</em> bedtools merge for CNVs positions.</p>

<p>There are 69 high confidence CNVs, of which 5 (4 deletions and 1 duplication) of them are shared among all Kveiks. Interestingly, the two deletions in chromosome I and the one in chromosome XV are duplications in the lineage “Granvin1, Hornindal1, Hornindal2, Voss1”. Granvin1, Hornindal1, Hornindal2, Voss1 shares a unique fingerprint of 39 conserved CNVs scattered across 15 chromosomes.</p>

<p>Let’s see which genes (and corresponding functions) are interested by the CNVs that we identify in the farmhouse yeasts. We will run the following functional analyses:</p>
<ul>
<li>over-represented GO terms;</li>
<li>enriched GO terms;</li>
<li>over-represented KEGG pathways;</li>
<li>enriched KEGG pathways;</li>
<li>over-represented Reactome pathways;</li>
